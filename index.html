        <p class="about-me">
          My name is Dawood Kamalie. I am a CPUT student with an extreme love for the IT and ICT fields and professions.
          I enjoy coding, playing guitar and learning a variety of different skills, skills such as; cooking, plumbing, marketing, business and a whole lot more.
          I find myself manifested frequently in leadership roles due to my problem solving and leadership skills as well deep understanding in communication in
          both the conscious and subconscious. Below are some artifacts I've collect within my year of the HCINCT course.

        <img class="artB" src="./cvpic.PNG" width="100%" height="100%" alt="">
        <p class="artC">While going through the process of preparing the Resume, I realised the importance of being as clear as possible about my abilities and
           skills, and that the organisation and structure of the information affects the reader drastically. In resume's, an individual works with borrowed time,
          this is the time that a resume writer has to convince the reader before the reader stops reading.<br><br>
          I also realised that when writing resume's, it is important to showcase some personality as well as it helps an individual stand out more. To check out my resume, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JAc4b0OJ_vuunsmiCFPoAo_Kkr1-eZtl/view?usp=sharing">click here.</a> </p>

        <h1 class='art2A'>Personality Profiling</h1>
        <img class="art2C" src="./DawoodKamaliePersonalityProfile2.PNG" width="100%" height="100%" alt="">
        <p class="art2D">I am a <strong>Consul</strong>, but as I reflect upon personality profiling, I've noticed a brewing trend to place labels on different personalities in order for us to
          justify their actions and understand them better. There is a massive flaw in this as it creates false expectations for what these personality types
          should be like. I feel like, to a certain extent there were many items that was found true about my assessment, but one's entire being and personality
         can't be placed into a single box. We are multi-level beings with different emotions for different timings. <br><br>
        I also realised that the entire basis of measurement consisted of no negative traits to be assessed upon, for example narcissism.
        Which really adds to creating a platform for free validation instead of a well rounded complete personality assessment. In conclusion, I think that they
        captured certain traits quite well, and some others not so well.</p>

        <p class="art3E">It can be quite scary to know that your entire life can be captured and recorded on the internet, with extra focus and amplification
          on the negative parts of our past actions. The internet can be a dangerous place, and it seems that our internet presence is defined by the digital footprint
          we leave behind. This was the very reason I double checked the digital footprint I was leaving behind and removed anything that may have been a consequence of my younger
          immature self. <br><br> The way in which I went about clearing my online presense was to close all accounts i'm not using and on any existing accounts, to edit and remove
          some of my personal content.

        <p class="art4C" >As I reflect back upon the informational interview, I realise how important it is to ask the right questions.
          How valuable it is to plan, and to plan properly. I fully understand how important it is to treat people well and that word of mouth can
          be the very cause of your companyâ€™s success or downfall.<br><br> It is therefore important to maintain a good reputation.
          In accordance to that, it is equally important to do proper screening which can be absolutely vital when starting a business. To check out the informational interview, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_kUtrrskOCrgJN1eKNbILZ1spyXqGF18/view?usp=sharing">click here.</a> </p>

        <h1 class="sub1B">Programming</h1><br>
        <p class="sub1C">
          This subject helped me learn how to think in a very logical structured manner as well as how to go about assessing processes in a logical order.
          I also had an opportunity to refine my coding language skills such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. As a matter of fact, it is those very skills that
          I used to create this portfolio you're reading right now.
          <br>
          There are a variety of skills I learnt as well. Some of the skills I learnt were patience, attention to detail, self-reliance, independance, resourfulness,
          logic and language, thinking in an abstract manner, strengthened memory and much more.
          <br>
          As I reflect upon my experience learning to code, I realised that coding is based more on learning by yourself than learning from a tutor or teacher.
          To understand each concept you will have to learn from your own experience. It also develops important skills that can be useful in many other parts of life.

        <h1 class="sub2B">Professional Communications</h1>
        <p class="sub2C">
          This subject highlighted how important good communication really is, and that subconscious communication is an essential
          element in all communication. It also displayed that there are various cultures and how each culture, group or individual communicates with one another.
          <br>
          Some of the skills I learnt from this subject, includes being able to read body language, gestures, tone of voice, making better speeches and much more.
          <br>
          As I reflect upon my experience learning the key fundamentals of communication, I remember how excited I was. It was as if learning
          a secret language that nobody spoke but it had so much power to influence others. It made me go even further to read book upon book about body language
          and the psychology behind it.
          <br>
          One of my favourite assignments for this subject was about Geert Hofstede's dimensions in culture, if you'd like to see the video,

        <h1 class="sub3B">Business</h1>
        <p class="sub3C">
          Business was one of my favourite subjects. I found that what was being taught was extremely relevent to the real world
          as I tried starting my own busines. I followed each process along all the way through which made it really insightful and fun.
          <br>
          I learnt a variety of different skills from this subject, it taught me professional communication, leading a team, marketing, planning through the use of
          the simplex process and problem solving. It also gave me a chance to try things while I learnt.
          <br>
          As I reflect upon my experience learning this subject, I notice an evident love for business and entrepenearship and what that could potentially mean for
          myself and for South Africa. I realise that even though one may have knowledge of everything required to start a business, one key aspect still remains...
          and that is the willingness or confidence to take risks and to get up after you have failed numerous times.
          <br>
          An assignment that really had my brain working on overdrive, in which I had an opportunity to showcase my leadership capabilities was when we had to draw up
          a real business model using the simplex process to solve a real world issue, I still feel confident that the business model can succeed due to how well
          thought of it was. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xfLz1JFarePMRxwk9RKJ8_oJR6MVqvaB/view?usp=sharing">Click here to see the presentation slides</a>.
